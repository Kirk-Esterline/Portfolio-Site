        <p>We worked with a local small business owner to establish their new website and online store.  There were specific goals which the owner wanted achieved, and by working together we were able to achieve them all, including a specific product filtering method.  We collaborated closely to ensure that the website design matched the branding on the store front and relayed the local feel of the store.</p>
